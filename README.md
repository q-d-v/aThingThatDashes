## Welcome to the *official* ATTD repository!
### What is this?
This is the official repository of one of my games that I'm making, A Thing That Dashes. It's a minimalist 2D platformer game that is still in development.
### What will I do here?
In this repository, I will upload every single version of ATTD starting this repository's creation, but I will also talk about my experiences with coding, reveal sneek peeks, and, rarely, release beta versions of upcoming updates.
